       |___/          BLUE TEAM / SOC LABS



I am a cybersecurity learner focused on **blue-team and SOC fundamentals**, with a strong interest in how defenders **observe, detect, and reason** about security events through logs, alerts, and network signals.

Most of my learning is **hands-on**. I design and build lab environments to understand what security data actually looks like from a defender’s perspective — not just how tools work, but **how analysts think**.

## 🔍 Core Focus
- Log analysis & alert triage  
- Network traffic fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP)  
- Early-stage detection & signal vs. noise  
- Mapping observations to **MITRE ATT&CK**  
- Defensive monitoring workflows (learning-first mindset)

---

## 🧪 Featured Lab Project
**Operation Iron Watch**  
A structured SOC lab focused on:
- Security monitoring
- Investigation workflow
- Evidence collection & documentation
- Detection logic aligned with MITRE ATT&CK

*(Details documented in private/public lab repositories as appropriate)*

---

## 📚 Current Learning Path
- SOC Analyst fundamentals (L1/L2 concepts)
- Defensive Security Operations
- Threat Detection & Analysis
- Offensive Security Foundations (to better understand adversary behavior)
- **Detection Engineering (foundational – rules, alerts, correlations)*
---

## 🧠 Lab Philosophy
- Strong isolation  
- Controlled exposure  
- Minimal attack surface  
- **Document what is observed, not what is assumed**
